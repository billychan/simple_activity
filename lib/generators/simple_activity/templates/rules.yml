# Sample Activity settings
#
# How to write rules
#   * Model class name at first level
#   * '_cache` at second level. It's for defining things to cache
#   * The third level allows only keys as `actor` or `target`.
#     - actor is the user who initiate this action. For example, the
#       man who wrote an article, the man who liked a comment.
#     - target is the resource itself. It represents the only instance variable
#       you processed in controller. e.g. the article wrote, the comment
#       be liked, or the like itself if "Like" is the model
#     - Any other things are based on actor or target.
#   * The fourth level represents the method available in actor's or taget's
#     model. The value will be stored for caching.
#     - Item(s) here must be in array(with dash and one space before it)
#     - The model must respond to such methods.

# Comment:
#   _cache:

#       #  condition: within_1_day_of_article
#       # - commentable_user: 2
# Article:
